Hi Professor:
        https://github.com/huangyingw/AllPrime.
        The above URL is my repository for today's Lab, it takes me 13 minutes, and 6 commits, with meaningless commit log "n".
        For personal code, I just simply commit with log "n", sorry for this.
        My habit is to create branch for feature add, or bug fix.
